Welcome to the Ximix distribution.

Ximix is a network application for doing threshold cryptography, including key generation, signatures, and decryption. It also includes a MixNet based on static RPC.

Ximix was largely made possible through the sponsorship of the Victorian Electoral Commission as part of the vVote project in 2013/2014.


1. Build Setup.

Building the distribution requires, at a minimum, gradle 1.8 and JDK 1.7. As the application makes liberal use of the JCE you *must* have the unrestricted policy files for the JCE installed.

Once you have gradle installed you need to type:

gradle fetch_libs

To download the dependencies. At the moment fetch_libs is required as not all the dependencies are available in the Maven repository.

2. Building

Type:

gradle build

to compile the sources and run the current test suite. The test suite takes a while at the moment as it uses the same timeouts as production for dealing with missing nodes.

3. Generating coverage analysis

Type:

gradle clean
gradle build coverage

To compile and run the tests with coverage analysis. The output from the anyliser will appear in the build/reports directory.

4. Generating JavaDoc

Type:

gradle apiJavaDoc

to generate the JavaDoc. The JavaDoc will appear in build/docs.
