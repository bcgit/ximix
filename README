Welcome to the Ximix distribution.

1. Build Setup.

Building the distribution requires, at a minimum, gradle 1.8 and JDK 1.7.

Once you have gradle installed you need to type:

gradle fetch_libs

To download the dependencies. At the moment fetch_libs is required as not all the dependencies are available in the Maven repository.

2. Building

Type:

gradle build

to compile the sources and run the current test suite. The test suite takes a while at the moment as it uses the same timeouts as production for dealing with missing nodes.

3. Generating coverage analysis

Type:

gradle clean
gradle build coverage

To compile and run the tests with coverage analysis. The output from the anyliser will appear in the build/reports directory.

4. Generating JavaDoc

Type:

gradle apiJavaDoc

to generate the JavaDoc. The JavaDoc will appear in build/docs.

5. Further Information.

See the file LICENSE in this directory for license information.

To find out more in general, have a look at http://www.cryptoworkshop.com/ximix for information on running the installer generators and building nodes.
